# Next.js Version Decision

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Decision:** Use Next.js 15+ (latest stable) instead of Next.js 14

## Context

The original documentation referenced Next.js 14, which was the current version when the documentation was written (October 2025). However, at project start (October 30, 2025), Next.js 16.0.1 is the latest available version.

## Analysis

- **Documentation review**: No explicit "strictly required" or "minimum version" language found
- **Feature requirements**: All required features (App Router, Server Components, Server Actions, Streaming) are available and stable in Next.js 15+
- **Latest version**: 16.0.1

## Decision

Use **Next.js 15+** (latest stable version at time of setup)

## Rationale

1. **Future-proof**: Latest features, performance improvements, and security updates
2. **No breaking changes**: All required features are stable and enhanced in newer versions
3. **Better maintenance**: Starting with the latest version reduces technical debt
4. **Active support**: Latest versions receive active support and updates
5. **No downsides**: No compatibility issues identified with our tech stack

## Changes Made

Updated all documentation references from "Next.js 14" to "Next.js 15+" in:
- CLAUDE.md
- README.md
- docs/architecture.md
- docs/implementation-plan.md
- docs/processes/coding-standards.md
- docs/readiness-assessment.md
- docs/local-development.md
- docs/implementation-phases/phase-1-foundation-i18n/README.md

Also updated React (18+) and TypeScript (5+) version references to use "+" suffix for consistency.

## Implementation

Will install Next.js using:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

This ensures we get the latest stable version at time of project initialization.
