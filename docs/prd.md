# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 3.1
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

**Vision**: Build an independent, highly customizable multi-city platform that enables cities worldwide to document and visualize their linguistic diversity. Starting with Amsterdam, the platform is designed from day 1 to support multiple cities with deep customization capabilities.

**Approach**: Build completely new application using modern architecture, designed for multi-instance deployment with flexible taxonomies, static content management, and per-city branding.

**Timeline**: 16-19 weeks for MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - includes i18n, AI generation, multi-city support, flexible taxonomies, and content management

**Key Innovation**:
- **Flexible Classification System**: Cities define their own language taxonomies (e.g., Amsterdam: Size/Status; Tokyo: Script Type/Official Status)
- **Static Content Management**: Built-in CMS for About pages, methodology, team sections, and custom content
- **Per-City Branding**: Custom logos, colors, and themes
- **Multi-Database Ready**: Abstraction layer enables future data sovereignty options

**Architecture**: Multi-instance platform where each city can deeply customize their language classification, content, and branding while sharing infrastructure.

## üéØ Key Decisions Made

### Strategic Decisions ‚úÖ
- **Branding**: Independent platform (not tied to ELA)
- **Multi-City**: Build for multiple cities from day 1
- **Target Cities**: Flexible - any city can be onboarded
- **Business Model**: To be determined (options left open)
- **Development**: Solo project (timeline adjusted accordingly)

### Technical Decisions ‚úÖ
- **Census Overlays**: Skipped for MVP (simplifies scope significantly)
- **User Roles**: Superuser + Admin + Operator (three-tier hierarchy)
- **Launch Deadline**: Flexible, no hard deadline
- **i18n Support**: Built-in from day 1 (database + frontend)
- **Geographic Hierarchy**: Structured cities ‚Üí districts ‚Üí neighborhoods
- **World Data**: Structured world regions and countries tables
- **Multi-City Access**: Users can have permissions for multiple cities
- **Multi-City Views**: Single URL can display data from multiple cities
- **AI Descriptions**: Support for AI-generated descriptions with source management
- **Flexible Taxonomies**: Cities define custom language classification systems (replaces hardcoded enums)
- **Static Content CMS**: Built-in page builder for About, Methodology, and custom pages
- **Per-City Branding**: Custom logos, colors, fonts configurable per city
- **Database Abstraction**: Abstraction layer from day 1 for future multi-database support

### Pending Decisions ‚è∏Ô∏è
- **URL Structure**: Subdomain vs path-based (recommend deciding before Phase 1)
- **Monetization Strategy**: Can be decided post-launch
- **Default Languages**: Which UI languages to support initially (suggest: English, Dutch, French)
- **Project/Brand Name**: What should the platform be called?
- **Domain Name**: Finalize domain registration

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations

Cities worldwide want to document and visualize their linguistic diversity, but face several challenges:

1. **No Flexible Tools**: Existing solutions have hardcoded data models that don't fit different cities' needs
2. **No Customization**: Cities can't define their own language classification schemes
3. **Data Sovereignty Concerns**:
   - "Our data must stay in our country" (GDPR compliance)
   - "We want full database access for our own analytics"
   - "What if we want to self-host later?"
4. **No Content Control**: Cities can't customize their about pages, methodology, or branding
5. **Multi-Language Complexity**: No built-in internationalization support
6. **Manual Work**: Creating descriptions and translations is time-consuming

### City-Specific Concerns

**Amsterdam**:
- Community Size (Small/Medium/Large)
- Endangerment Status (Safe/Vulnerable/Endangered)

**Tokyo** (hypothetical):
- Script Type (Logographic/Syllabic/Alphabetic)
- Official Status (Official/Recognized/Minority)

**Mexico City** (hypothetical):
- Historical Period (Pre-Hispanic/Colonial/Modern)
- Geographic Origin (Local/Migrant)

## Remaining Questions

### Technical
1. **URL structure final decision**: Path-based or subdomain?
   - *Recommendation*: Path-based (`language-map.org/amsterdam`) for simplicity

2. **Project/brand name**: What should we call it?
   - Current: "Language Map" (generic)
   - Suggestions: "Linguamap", "PolyglotCity", "WorldLang", "CityTongues"?

3. **Domain**: Do you own `language-map.org` or similar?

### Data
4. **Amsterdam Airtable**: Do I have access to API key already?

5. **Other cities**: Any specific cities you want to target first?
   - Academic contacts in Paris/Toronto/London?
   - Existing datasets available?

### Business
6. **Monetization timeline**: When do we want to start charging (if at all)?

7. **Target cities**: Any specific outreach plans or partnerships?
